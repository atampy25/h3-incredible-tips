        "1669224969": "If you throw something, people will investigate. It doesn't need to be a coin. Coins are largely useless.",

        "2674618819": "The red cross in the reticle means you've severely injured someone. The Red Cross in real life means someone has been severely injured.",
        "2708665481": "If someone sees you but you knock them out, they can still remember you. They likely will for the rest of their lives, depending on exactly what they saw.",

        "2887763763": "Keypads are extremely easy to find the answer to. Usually it's written down in an extremely obvious place nearby.",
        "2892793038": "You can take the clothes of someone in a box, but not kill them. Curious",
        "2951673230": "Doors can be opened by shooting quickly using the pause menu. This is called a mudshot, which is a very elegant name.",
