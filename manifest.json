        "1669224969": "If you throw something, people will investigate. It doesn't need to be a coin. Coins are largely useless.",
        "2286543114": "If someone sees you throw a brick, they'll be annoyed at you for littering. This is perfectly logical.",
        "1737198132": "VIPs will be evacuated in the event of an emergency. Place a bomb at the evacuation point.",

        "4268354613": "Punching someone in the face is loud. Punching someone in the back of the head is completely silent. This is logical.",
